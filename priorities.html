                <b>HOUSING SOLUTIONS</b>
                <br>Solving our housing crisis takes regional collaboration and steadfast leadership. Melissa is a leading voice for housing action in our city and region. She represents our community on the Puget Sound Regional Council’s Growth Management Planning Board and King County’s Growth Management Planning Council.
                
                <br><br>Accomplishments
                <br>
                <li>
                  Championed stronger affordability requirements in Overlake and Downtown Redmond through tools like expanded inclusionary zoning, development incentive packages, and more.
                <li>
                  Consistently stands up for the housing we need most–including regulatory packages for permanent supportive housing, investments in the Housing Trust Fund, and strategic subsidy for the development of below market-rate housing in our urban centers.
              </p>

              <br><p>
                <b>CLIMATE RESILIENCE & READINESS</b>
                <br>Redmond is home to dedicated climate champions in our neighborhoods, businesses, and government. Melissa represents Redmond’s sustainability priorities at the Association of Washington Cities Legislative Priorities Committee and National League of Cities Energy, Environment, and Natural Resources Committee.
                <br><br>Accomplishments
                <br>
                <li>
                  Co-sponsored legislation to support the preservation of our state’s Climate Commitment Act–a program that has already provided more than $2M in heat-pump conversions for low and moderate income residents, climate planning, and our state’s first electric fire apparatus.
                <li>
                  Ensured that future residents in multi-family buildings will have homes designed to fully participate in recycling, compositing, and overall cleaner solid waste systems. Melissa continues to champion legislation at the state level that would shift the burden back to producers of packaging, plastics, and paper products.
              </p>

              <br><p>
                <b>COMMUNITY HEALTH & PUBLIC SAFETY</b>
                <br>Melissa is proud to work alongside residents, community-based organizations, and her Council colleagues to tackle some of the most pressing issues of the moment. Following the voter’s rejection of the last public safety levy lid lift, Melissa served on a special subcommittee of the Council to help solve the $6M funding gap. Additionally, she serves as a board member at Together Center, a non-profit human services hub in Downtown Redmond.
                <br><br>Accomplishments
                <br>
                <li>
                  Collaborated with colleagues across two budgets to increase staffing and service levels in: Mobile Integrated Health, co-response and Mental Health Professionals, fire suppression in North Redmond and Education Hill, and more.
                <li>
                  Secured funding and partnership so that Redmond Police can host incentivized events to collect unwanted and/or improperly stored firearms from Redmond residents. The first of two collection events will be open to residents in April 2025.
