              Melissa and her family have lived in Redmond’s Overlake neighborhood for 10 years. They love their neighborhood’s amenities such as Indian grocery stores, great transit lines, and good schools. They are very eager for the light rail stations to open, and to one day have a park in the neighborhood’s urban center.
